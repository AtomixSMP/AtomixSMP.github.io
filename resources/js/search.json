[[{"i":"1-1-defining-the-problem","l":"❓ 1.1 Defining the Problem","p":["Assist with debugging process for OS issues.","Atomix Settings Manager Pro (My Solution), Is a system utility/toolkit for windows 10/11. It allows the user to access more advanced and hidden settings/tweaks which aren't available from within the built in settings app. It also allows the user to manage the programs that open on startup in a more robust and controlled way than the Task Manager App that comes with windows. AtomixSMP Also provides a simple, yet stylish user interface which is consistent and familiar to the user as modeled after the Windows 11 Settings app so most users would already have an understanding for the Interface and allows the Program to act and feel like an Extension upon the Operating system and less like a third party tool.","Briefly describe the needs, boundaries and any issues relevant to the proposed solution.","Closed Source (FOR PUBLIC RELEASE)","Detects more/ALL startup programs form every source.","Enhance user control over their windows experience.","Enhance user privacy by minimizing Microsoft Telemetry.","Familiar UI Design and Layout.","General description of the program.
